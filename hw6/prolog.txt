Unification:

given two terms t1 and t2, find a *substitution* s mapping variables
to terms such that s(t1) is syntactically the same as s(t2)

the substitution s is in *solved form*:
 - any variable in the domain of s does not appear in the range of s

 pseudocode:

 c = c --> {}

 X = X --> {}

 X = t --> {X : t}

 t = X --> {X : t}

 // simplicity: assuming a binary relation
 c(t1,t2) = c(t1', t2')
     t1=t1' --> s
     s(t2) = s(t2') --> s'
     return s U s'

otherwise
   throw Exception("no")
   
**note: make sure the result is in solved form
